This application is modeled after the popular tile matching game, Tetris. The objective of our application is 
to attempt to score as many points as possible while completing lines using differently shaped game pieces. When 
a line is completed with blocks across the board, the row will disappear and grant the player points. The game 
comes to a stop when the stacked blocks reach the top of the board and the player is no longer able to manipulate
the pieces. To manipulate the pieces the user uses the arrow keys: left, right and down to move, and up to rotate. 
After the game ends, the user's score will be stored in a high scores file and displayed on the high scores screen 
from the main menu. The settings menu has several options including the ability to change what music you would like 
to play and the difficulty the game should be set at.

Known Bugs:

1. While playing the sound track if you switch between menus and then play another sound track they will play over the top of each other instead of stopping one sound track and playing another. 

2. You have to leave a sound track playing for a couple seconds in settings before changing menus so it doesnt cut off.
